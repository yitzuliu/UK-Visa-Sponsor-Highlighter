**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29

## 1. Introduction
"UK Visa Sponsor High-lighter" ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension collects, uses, and discloses information.

## 2. Data Collection and Use
**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

*   **Sponsor Data**: The extension fetches the public "Register of Worker and Temporary Worker licensed sponsors" directly from the official UK Government website (`gov.uk`). This data is stored locally on your device (`chrome.storage.local`) for performance purposes.
*   **Browsing Activity**: The extension runs locally on your browser to identify company names on LinkedIn and Indeed. **No browsing history, URLs, or page content is sent to our servers or any third party.** All matching logic happens on your device.

## 3. Permissions
We request the minimum permissions necessary for the extension to function:
*   `storage`: To cache the sponsor list locally.
*   `alarms`: To schedule automatic updates of the sponsor list (every 30 days).
*   `Host Permissions` (LinkedIn, Indeed, GOV.UK): To read company names on job boards and fetch the official sponsor list.

## 4. Third-Party Services
*   **GOV.UK**: We fetch public data from `assets.publishing.service.gov.uk`. Please refer to their privacy policy for information on how they handle server requests.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
